# Inverse-kinematics
The traj.py is used to obtain a simple x,y trajectory using the robot function
The codes have comments are easy to follow. 
The following are needed to better understand the code. 
Basic mathematics and geometry is required especially in the robot.py. 
Knowledge of Denavit Herternberg Parameters (DHP). 
Working with numpy math library. 
Use the test.py to test the main code, feel free to change the cordinates. 
However since the relation is a straight line, error may occur when dividing by zero in the finding of the slope. 
Feel free to tweak the fx function to not only generate a straight line equation but ellips, or circe. 
This is just a demo of how to segment using the fx function
